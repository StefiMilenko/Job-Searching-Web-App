# Job-Searching-Web-App
Note: This is a group project I worked on with colleagues Luka Kostić and Uroš Janković.
This project uses a local database.
A job-searching web app similar to Linkedin, with more focus given to on-premise jobs. It is primarily aimed at users whose future job location is very important.
This app uses OpenStreetMap to geolocate all job locations and allow filtering based on distance from user's location(if the user enables location).
Users can be job-searchers(Trazilac) and employers (Poslodavac). Employers can post jobs, while job-searchers can post comments below jobs, rate jobs, and also post replies to other comments.
